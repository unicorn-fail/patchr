# Development

Development of this module is pretty straight forward.

It is recommended that you have at least a basic understanding of [Node.js]
development best practices before continuing. If not, please read their official
documentation before continuing.

## Prerequisites 

- [Node.JS]
- [Grunt.js] (install the global CLI tool)

## Setup

Install the [Node.js] modules by running `npm install` inside this cloned
repository. Note: this may take a while depending on your computer.

## Grunt commands

- `grunt` - Main grunt command will build the entire project
- `grunt watch` - Watches files and executes only the necessary tasks.

## Distribution

After everything is built, there will be a `dist` folder where the distribution
files (CSS and JS) will be located. These can be used in the browser.
